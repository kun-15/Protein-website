				<h2>How Your Whey Protein Is Made | Inside Our UK Protein Factory</h2>
				<p>Whey protein goes through many, many steps before it arrives at your door. But how exactly is it made? As part of a new series showing you what goes on behind the scenes, we sent Myprotein product technologist Paul Smith-Johnson to our Warrington factory to reveal all. Welcome to In The Lab.<br></p>
				<p>The Myprotein factory runs like clockwork, all day, every day, handling several hundred tonnes of whey protein and producing thousands of products in a week.
					When it comes to flavours, we analyse market trends to come up with some of our boldest and most intriguing ideas.
					(And of course we always listen to what customers are saying on social media to see what flavours you think we should come up with next.)</p><br>
				<p>Whey begins its journey on the farm, in the milk of dairy cows (the same cows that make the milk and cheese in your fridge).
					The milk goes through a process called pasteurisation, which kills off unwanted bacteria, is boiled, cooled and transported to a cheese manufacturing plant.
					After the pasteurisation process, the milk is 80% casein and 20% whey. Then the magic happens: naturally occurring enzymes are added to the milk to separate the whey from the casein, leaving a liquid and a cottage cheese-like solid.
					The liquid is then purified to remove fat, water and unwanted minerals, and then goes into a turbine to be dried and have any remaining solid particles separated.
					The end result is a 90% whey powder that’s finally ready to make the journey to our factory in Warrington. Hurray!</p><br>

			<h4>Exercises To Boost Your Energy</h4>
			<p>In logical terms exercise is linked to using energy. But raising your output can actually lift your energy levels in general.
			Let’s dive in to how and why.</p><br>
			<p>There are a number of ways and reasons you might be feeling low on energy or low in mood. Everyone is different here, but exercise has been shown to have such a positive effect on both energy levels and mood.
			This has been shown in both acute changes (from a single session) as well as chronic (from changing lifestyle from less active to increasing activity levels).</p>	<br>
			<h6>Why do I have low Energy?</h6>
			<p>Low energy can come from a number of reasons, part of which can be to do with physiological reasons such as metabolism of stored energy, decreases of blood sugar, lack of oxygen to the brain and muscles, and decreases in serotonin and dopamine in the brain.
				You can address each of these with exercise in a range of forms from higher intensity to low intensity relaxation and meditation.
				One big reason for low energy is overstimulation.
				So much of our daily lives are linked to stress, including lifestyle choices like caffeine that ramp your body into high energy feelings.
				Your body needs time to unwind and relax as well so that it can ramp itself up to a higher level.
				This doesn’t have to follow your regular programme, it could be a complete break from the normal and you might adapt or change your workout to suit you and how you feel at that time. However, it might be just powering through your planned session and feeling revitalised by completing it.</p><br>

				<h4>What Is The Coffee & Lemon Diet?<br> Benefits & Side Effects</h4>
				<p>Lemon coffee is pretty simple. In the morning, you add a squeezed lemon to a cup of black coffee and drink it on an empty stomach.</p><br>
				<h6>Is there any truth to these claims?</h6>
				<p>Put simply, no. There’s nothing contained in either ingredient that will magically help you lose weight and tone up your stomach. Fat loss is reliant on a sustained calorie deficit, i.e. consuming fewer calories than you expend.1 No individual food can contribute to fat loss in the way these claims suggest.
				But coffee lemon is far from the worst trend out there, and both ingredients do have their benefits that may help contribute to your weight loss goals and general health when combined with other factors. For instance, black coffee may be helpful for weight loss if replacing a higher-calorie milky coffee, such as a flat white, cappuccino or latte, as this may bring you into a calorie deficit.

				<h2>Full Body Workouts | Building Muscle And Burning Calories</h2>
				<p>Traditional workout splits that focus on individual muscle groups are great. There’s something pleasingly satisfying about having a day dedicated to each part of the body — leg day, chest day, arm day. 

					But this way of organising workouts isn't for everyone. Sometimes, when you’re short on time, a full-body workout is exactly what you need. They’re time efficient, a nice change from the regular, and you definitely feel like you’ve had a proper workout. 
					
					Here’s everything you need to know about full-body workouts, including their benefits and how to make the most of them. </p><br>
				<h5>Building Muscle And Strength</h5>
				<p>Hypertrophy training is essential for muscle growth, but with a split training plan, some muscle groups are only hit once a week. Full-body workouts mean you can target muscle groups up to 3-4 times a week. Compound movements, like squats and deadlifts, commonly feature in full-body workouts, challenging large sections of the body while building strength. </p><br>
				<h5>Who are full body workouts for?</h5>
					
				<p>Full-body workouts are for anyone and everyone. They’re great if you want to refresh your training plan, want to save time in the gym, burn calories, or just building muscle and strength. 

					Even if you like a split training plan, you could still gain some of the benefits by dedicating one full day to a full-body workout. </p><br>
